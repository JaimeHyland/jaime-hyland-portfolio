You can try it out if you like (use the shift or control key to choose more than one modestly sized pdf file). Inspired by some mixed experiences I have recently had trying to merge pdf files for my job search effort and by the strong interest in privacy of German consumers in particular, I've decided to attempt to build an app that merges pdf files without requiring the user to upload their private files and then download the final merged file.",

By the time I arrived it had grown into a suite of products based on C, C++, Java and others, all communicating with a large Oracle DB, and all needing JIT localization of software UIs and documentation into 14 languages and dialects. A complex localization system had developed organically at the company over the years, responsibility for which is what I inherited when I joined the company in 2004.",
      "desc2": "Apart from the organizational issues due to the history and complexity of this suite of software that I faced in common with other technical staff members, I was confronted with a battery of specialized i18n and l10n conundrums, including the following:",

          "A large HTML-based help bundle (generated from MS word docs using Doc2Help) that required much manual manipulation for correct localization ",
          "A variety of bespoke and market-adjusted packages, each requiring different locale combinations",
          "A good deal of less-than-perfect internationalization work in the source code (unclear concatenations, hard-coded numerical formats, unexplained text fragments, etc.)",
          "Each new build of the suite of programs required a new, human-initiated localization round",

          "Used Passolo with Java Swing to resolve locale-based formatting issues in software UIs",
          "Leveraged translation memory (Transit) to ensure no semantically identical strings needed repeated localization",
