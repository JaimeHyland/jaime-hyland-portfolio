You can try it out if you like (use the shift or control key to choose more than one modestly sized pdf file). Inspired by some mixed experiences I have recently had trying to merge pdf files for my job search effort and by the strong interest in privacy of German consumers in particular, I've decided to attempt to build an app that merges pdf files without requiring the user to upload their private files and then download the final merged file.",
